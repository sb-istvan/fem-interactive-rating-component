## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my first challenge involving JavaScript so I was curious about my skills. I applied my own logic to handle rating selection and display selected rating on the subsequent "Thank you" card.

Beyond the challenge's requirement I also added a function to show warning message if the user tries to Submit without selecting a rating.

### Continued development

To my surprise I could handle JavaScrpit DOM manipulation pretty well. However as for the CSS I felt like I was continously just patching it for the Thank You card and I could not make it significantly better on my final code review either. I'm pretty sure there are better solutions for that.
